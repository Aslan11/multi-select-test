#### Download Current Dataset ####

The MongoDB dataset for ModelDrop is backed up hourly on the remote server. Before developing locally, it's nice to have a fresh copy of the data to work against. Below is a common way to copy the remote backup and import the dataset to your local machine.

```
	// 1. Copy mongodump file from remote server to local machine
	scp root@107.170.194.72:/modeldrop/data_backup/mongodump.zip ~/Desktop
	// Pass: mebgxewsluzd

	// 2. Unzip and import dataset to local machine
	mongorestore --db modeldrop ~/Desktop/modeldrop
```
